                <h3>American Pale Ale</h3>
                <p>The American Pale Ale is become known as a classic craft beer style. The American Pale Ale can trace its roots to beer styles from abroad.It was inspired by the English Pale Ale, replacing its English counterpart's earthy, herbal hops with generous additions of boldly citrus and pine-like American varieties. As one of the most popular American beer styles, pale ale beer is not hard to track down, bu the various takes on this iconic style makes it impossible American to jam eveything there is to know about American Pale Ale beer on one page.</p>
                <p>Characterised by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous American hops, the American Pale Ale is a medium-bodied beer with low to medium caramel, and carries with it a toasted maltiness. American Pale Ale is one of the most food-friendly styles to enjoy.The American Pale Ale's affinity to food can be attributed to the simplicity of its ingredients, which include toasty pale malt, a clean fermenting ale beer yeast, and the counterbalance of American hops to help tease out the flavour or cleanse the palate, preparing you for another bite.</p>
                <p>American Pale Ale beer remains a staple of the American beer world because it continues to evolve. With each passing day, independent breweries across the country are reimagining the classic pale ale by experimenting with local ingredients to craft flavour profiles that push the boundaries of beer.</p>
