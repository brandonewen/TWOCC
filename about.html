                My relationship with Craft Beer was love at first sip, with my first Craft Beer being over 3 years ago.
                Ever since then, I have dedicated my career to the Craft Beer industry, learning an unbelieavable amount, under the tutorage of amazing teachers.
                I've been to 100+ venues, industry events, festivals and breweries so far... with more to come.
                I'm extremely passionate about Craft Beer and wanted to use my expertise to educate others.
                I have done enormous amounts of research into Craft Beer, which I've gained through attending brewing days, beer courses, talking with brewers, owners, suppliers, Craft Beer fans and independent research.
                As I learn more, this website with be updated, with new techniques and Craft Beer Styles.

                Since meeting Brandon, I would try whatever he was trying and I slowly fell in love with Sours!
                I've attended countless festivals and breweries too, in which the experience of trying something new was astonishing.
                With a keen interest in sours and mead, trying anything and everything to expand my knowledge and even starting to brew my own mead!
                It is a facsinating niche in the world, with so much diversity. I love educating, as a teacher myself. It's great to teach people, so this is a great way to teach people the intricacies of Craft Beer!
